        <!-- position: slightly raised to avoid z-fighting with marker if needed, but 0 0 0 is fine too. Let's do 0 0.5 0 like the box example or just flat. 
             User asked to show the image. Usually images are vertical or flat.
             Let's make it vertical so it's visible when looking at the marker.
             However, a flat image on the marker might be what they mean. 
             If I look at the user's box example, it was at 0 0.5 0.
             Let's put the image at 0 0 0 but rotate it -90 on X to lie flat? Or just vertical?
             Usually "show the image... on a marker" implies it pops up.
             Let's use an <a-image> which is a plane that always faces the camera by default unless we rotate it.
             Wait, <a-image> in A-Frame is a plane.
             Let's stick to a standard plane/image that rotates.
